# 📄 Abstract

ElderEase is an intelligent IoT-based health monitoring system designed to provide real-time tracking and proactive care for elderly individuals.

Phase 1 establishes a rule-based monitoring architecture using Node-RED, enabling structured health data simulation, validation, classification, and logging.  

The system follows an event-driven, flow-based design and is built entirely using open-source technologies to ensure FOSS compliance.  

This phase serves as the foundational layer for future expansions including database integration, full-stack web dashboards, and machine learning-based predictive analytics.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Elderly individuals living independently face significant health risks such as:

- Sudden heart rate spikes  
- Low oxygen saturation  
- Fever episodes  
- Lack of continuous monitoring  

Most existing systems are reactive and hardware-dependent. ElderEase aims to create a scalable monitoring architecture starting with a simulated real-time pipeline.

# 🏗️ System Architecture 

![ElderEase System Architecture](docs/images/system-architecture.png)

    ### ⚙️ System Overview

ElderEase is designed as a **real-time IoT-based health monitoring system** that enables continuous tracking of elderly patients.

This architecture represents a scalable, real-world deployment of ElderEase with IoT integration.

### 🔄 System Workflow

1. **Health Sensors**
   - Wearable sensors capture vital parameters:
     - Heart Rate  
     - SpO₂  
     - Temperature  

2. **IoT Microcontroller**
   - ESP32 collects and processes sensor data  
   - Prepares data for transmission  

3. **Wireless Communication**
   - Data is transmitted via Wi-Fi using HTTP APIs  

4. **Backend Processing**
   - Node.js + Express processes incoming data  
   - Applies health logic and risk evaluation  

5. **Data Storage**
   - MongoDB stores patient health records  
   - Enables historical tracking and analytics  

6. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Caregivers can:
     - View patient vitals in real-time  
     - Receive alerts  
     - Monitor trends and risk scores  

7. **AI Insights Layer**
   - Generates health insights and recommendations  
   - Provides predictive risk scoring
